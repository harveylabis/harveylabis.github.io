<h1>Hi! I'm Harvey :)</h1>

<h2>Welcome to my personal website.</h2>

I am an engineering student who is passionate in electronics, computers, and programming.

Since the COVID pandemic has started, I was not able to perform the laboratories inside the campus. In fact, no actual laboratories happened instead we rely on simulators. This makes learning harder because no actual and practical experience of the concepts discussed in the class. Because of this, I decided to perform most laboratories all by myself without lab instruction because I believe it is crucial when it comes to learning electronics. Most of my blog posts in this site contains my attempts in performing electronics concepts I learned in the class.
